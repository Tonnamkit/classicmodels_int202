# Classic Models Project

## Overview
The Classic Models project is a Java-based web application that demonstrates various aspects of Java Servlets, JPA (Java Persistence API), and web development. It's designed as an educational tool for understanding the basics of web application development in Java.

## Features
- **Servlet Implementation**: Utilizes Java Servlets for handling HTTP requests and responses.
- **Database Interaction**: Demonstrates CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using JPA.
- **Authentication**: Implements basic authentication mechanisms.
- **Session Management**: Manages user sessions throughout the web application.
- **Product Catalog**: Displays a list of products with details.
- **Shopping Cart**: Basic shopping cart functionality for product selection and checkout.
- **Office Management**: Allows for the addition, update, and removal of office details.

## Technical Stack
- **Java**: Core programming language.
- **Servlets**: Used for handling requests and responses.
- **JPA**: For database interactions.
- **HTML/CSS**: For frontend development.
- **Maven**: Dependency management and project build.

## Getting Started
1. **Clone the Repository**: `git clone https://github.com/Tonnamkit/classicmodels_int202.git`
2. **Build the Project**: Navigate to the project directory and run `mvn clean install`.
3. **Run the Application**: Deploy the built application to a Servlet container like Tomcat.
4. **Access the Application**: Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8080/` (adjust the port according to your Tomcat configuration).

## Directory Structure
- `src/main/java`: Contains Java source files including servlets, entities, and utility classes.
- `src/main/resources`: Configuration files like `persistence.xml`.
- `src/main/webapp`: Web application resources including JSPs, HTML, CSS, and images.
